# ibmec-oop-lessons

This repository is a study portfolio and a resource for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** discipline, taught in the third semester of the **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** program at IBMEC.

The main goal is to store and organize my learning about the fundamentals of OOP, following a curriculum based on global software development standards.

The content is structured into lessons, where each lesson is a Java `package` containing classes created to solve in-class challenges.

### Best Practices and Project Configuration

This repository follows standard development best practices, including:

* **`.gitignore`**: A file that ensures only essential source code is versioned, keeping the repository clean and organized.
* **MIT License**: This defines the usage rights for the code, allowing other students and developers to use and modify the material for study purposes.

The intention is for this repository to serve as both a code portfolio and a study reference for other students.
